This is the code supporting the conclusions of the paper, whose abstract is the following:

*Global Hydrological Models (GHM) compute irrigation water demands based on sub-models on crop types and calendars, soil evapotranspiration processes, irrigation efficiencies, weather data and irrigated areas. Here we demonstrate that such design is overly complicated as irrigation water withdrawals are largely determined by irrigated areas only. We show that modeling water withdrawals as a function of irrigated areas eases the exploration of model uncertainties and allows the production of statistics on the model output, something unattainable by GHM due to their computational demands. The results suggest that GHM need to improve the balance between complexity and error and explicitly integrate uncertainties to provide more robust insights on agrarian strategies worldwide.*
